# AdvancedPlugins Ticket Response Library

Welcome to the **AdvancedPlugins Ticket Response Library**! This repository houses the `.yml` configuration for automatic responses to common support queries about our Spigot plugins. Our goal is to streamline support, improve user experience, and engage the community in helping us make this system even better.

## Repository Structure

- **support-responses.yaml**: This file contains the primary structure for keyword-based ticket responses. Each plugin has its own section, with categorized responses based on common queries and issues.

### Guidelines

- **Clarity**: Responses should be clear, concise, and directly address the issue.
- **Relevance**: Ensure that keywords and responses are relevant to the specific plugin or feature they're associated with.
- **Length**: Responses should be brief yet informative. Avoid overly long explanations; instead, link to the wiki or documentation where appropriate.
- **No Duplication**: Before adding a new keyword-response pair, ensure there isn't an existing similar response.
